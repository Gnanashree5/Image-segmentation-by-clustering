<h1>Image Processing and Segmentation Techniques</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This repository explores various image processing techniques, focusing on image segmentation using clustering methods. We delve into concepts such as Human Stereopsis, Binocular Fusion, and different clustering techniques like K-means, DBScan, and Agglomerative clustering. Additionally, we implement short boundary detection and background subtraction.

<h2>1. Introduction to Image Processing Techniques</h2>
In this section, we provide an overview of key concepts in image processing, including:

<h3>Segmentation by Clustering:</h3> Techniques like K-means, DBScan, and Agglomerative clustering.

<h3>Applications:</h3> Implementing short boundary detection and background subtraction.

<h3>Image Segmentation by Clustering Pixels:</h3> Detailed exploration of clustering methods to segment images effectively.

<h2>2. Image Segmentation Using K-means Clustering</h2>
This section demonstrates how to perform image segmentation using K-means clustering. Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments to simplify or change the representation of an image into something more meaningful.

<h3>Steps Followed:</h3>
<h3>Image Loading:</h3>

Load the image from a specified path and convert it to RGB color space for better processing.

<h3>Reshape Image:</h3>

Reshape the image from a 3D array (height, width, color channels) to a 2D array of pixels. This makes it suitable for applying K-means clustering.

<h3>Apply K-means Clustering:</h3>

Define the number of clusters (K) and apply K-means clustering to group similar pixels together.

<h3>Reshape Segmented Image:</h3>

Reshape the clustered pixels back to the original image dimensions to view the segmented image.

<h3>Display Images:</h3>

Use matplotlib to display the original and segmented images side-by-side for comparison.

<h2>3. Enhanced Image Processing: Grayscale, Boundary Detection, and Background Subtraction</h2>
Building upon the previous code, this section introduces grayscale conversion, boundary detection, and background subtraction with a blue background.

<h3>Steps Followed:</h3>
<h3>Image Loading and Display:</h3>

Load the image from a specified path, verify it's loaded correctly, and display it using matplotlib.

<h3>Grayscale Conversion:</h3>

Convert the RGB image to a grayscale image to simplify the boundary detection process.

<h3>K-means Clustering for Segmentation:</h3>

Similar to the previous code, apply K-means clustering to segment the image into different clusters.

<h3>Boundary Detection:</h3>

Use the Canny edge detection algorithm on the grayscale image to detect edges and display the result.

<h3>Background Subtraction:</h3>

Apply a mask to subtract the background, setting it to blue while keeping the foreground (greenery) intact.

<h3>Display Processed Images:</h3>

Display the original image, grayscale image, segmented image, edge detection result, and the final image with background subtraction using matplotlib.
